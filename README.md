## About Zeton
Å»eton is a token-based reward system app for neurodivergent children and their families. 

Å»eton builds accountability and promotes good habits in home and school environments. It provides positive reinforcement and helps behaviour modification.

As parents, teachers and therapists, we know the daily struggles of children on the autistic spectrum, with learning disabilities or neurodevelopmental disorders. We believe that token economy and behavioural therapy elements should be accessible to everyone, so your kid can thrive at home as well as at school. Our goal is to help children become more and more independent over time, to the point of not needing the app ðŸ˜Š

# zeton_full_stack
Hello,

This is an experimental repository combining both our django API and React.js client.  
It utilizes the Git submodules concept, which you can familiarize yourself with [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)  and [here](https://medium.com/fiverr-engineering/working-with-git-submodules-ec6210801e07).


I suggest not using it as a development repository as it needs some more testing yet.  

You need configured connection to GitHub using SSH. You can do it with [this](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) tutorial.

## SETUP
1. To clone parent repository along with submodules use following command in the terminal:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules $repository_url
```  
(as a $repository_url use this repository url).   

2. Next, go to the zeton_react submodule, and checkout the 'develop' branch or your `branch_name`.
```
git checkout develop
```

3. Go back to the parent directory. Now you should be able to start the project with:   
```
docker-compose up --build
```  
4. You can access the React client at  
```
localhost:3000
```

5. The Dashboard view is empty now, as no data hasn't been fetched from the API yet.  
You can load the data from Django fixutres using:  
```
make load_data
```
6. Now the Dashboard view should present 2 examplary users.


7. To update submodules to latest version use command:  
```
git pull --recurse-submodules
```
